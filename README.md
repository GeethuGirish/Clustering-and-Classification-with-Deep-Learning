# Clustering-and-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

Clustering and Classification with Deep Learning on FashionMNIST(with a Twist) dataset was done as part of my coursework at the University of Waterloo. 
Conducted exploratory data analysis on these datasets from Kaggle. Pre-processed the data to treat the missing data and outliers. Performed feature extraction such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE and implemented different models such as KNN, Decision Tree, Ensemble methods including Random Forests, Adaboost, XG-Boost, Gradient Boosting and compared their performances.

Steps implemented:
1. Technologies: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
2. Classified the data using different CNN-based approaches.
3. An intermediate layer of the trained network is taken and the following feature extraction and clustering techniques were applied: PCA, t-SNE, DBSCAN, K-Means
